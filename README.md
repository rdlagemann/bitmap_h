# bitmap.h - C library
A little bitmap implementation. It's just for *educational purposes*.

## What is a bitmap?
"In computing, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits, that is, values which are zero or one. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index." 
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap).

## Getting Started
Include de library **bitmap.h** in your project and use it as you want. The **bitmapsample.c** is just a sample code where it's explained how the library works.

## Improvements
Feel free to use, modify and make improvements. It's just a scratch.
